        "Q.1 What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Python is a programming language which easy to learn and easy to understand due to its beginner-friendly approach.\n",
        "*   why Python is popular:\n",
        "1.   It is general purpose programming language\n",
        "2.   Python codes can be run on different platforms.\n",
        "3.   Python has many built-in libraries which can save time and efforts.\n",
        "4.   beginner friendly and easily understandable syntax.\n",
        "5.   Can be used for different applications like web development,data science,machine learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Python interpreter reads the pyhton code and translate it into byte code,and executes byte code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3 What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in python which has some specific meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4: Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: No. Keywords are pre-defined in python and we cannot use it as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5: What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Mutability is ability to change the value of an object after creation.\n",
        "With the help of mutability we can modify the object after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6: Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Lists are said to be mutable in nature because we can modify the list afetr its creation.Tuples once created it cannot be modified later, hence they are immutable in nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7: What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\"==\" : \"=\" is an equality operator which is used to check whether the objects are having same value or not.\n",
        "\"is\" : \"is\" is a operator which compares whether two varibles are pointing to the same object in the memory or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8: What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Logical operators in Python are symbols or words that evaluate multiple conditions and determine if an expression is true.\n",
        "The three logical operators in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   and\n",
        "2.   or\n",
        "3.   not\n",
        "\n",
        "1. and: If both the specified conditions are true,then result of this operator returns true.\n",
        "2. or: If one of the specified condition is true,then result of this operator returns true.\n",
        "3. not: It returns true if the condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9:What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:type casting refers to the changing data type from one to another.It is also known as type conversion.There are two types of type casting in python.\n",
        "1.Implicit type casting\n",
        "2.Explicit type caasting\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10: What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Explicit type conversion in programming is done manually by the programmer, while implicit conversion is handled automatically by the compiler.\n",
        "Implicit type casting happens when the compiler or interpreter automatically changes one data type into another and it is often invisible to the user.\n",
        "Explicit type casting requires the programmer to write code that instructs the compiler or interpreter to make a specific conversion and it is visible in the source code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11: What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The purpose of conditional statements in python is to control the flow of a program by executing different blocks of code based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12:  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true. If none of the conditions are true, the code will execute the else statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax for elif:**\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # execute code if condition1 is true\n",
        "elif condition2:\n",
        "    # execute code if condition2 is true\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # execute code if all conditions are false\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13:  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:for loop allows initialization, condition checking and iteration statements on the top of the loop, whereas while loop only allows initialization and condition checking at the top of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14: Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known before and a while loop is suitable for situations where the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on some dynamic condition.\n",
        "\n",
